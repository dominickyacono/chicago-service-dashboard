This personal project builds a urban analytics dashboard, transforming 311 service request data in Chicago into predictive insights.
By cleaning and transforming community-level data from the city of Chicago, I built a time-series model using a XGBoost regressor. 
Then, I funneled these predictions into an interactive Bokeh dashboard that provides granular detail.
